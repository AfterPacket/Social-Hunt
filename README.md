# 🕵️‍♂️ Social-Hunt

**Social-Hunt** is a professional-grade OSINT (Open Source Intelligence) framework designed for investigators, security researchers, and enthusiasts. It provides a unified dashboard to perform cross-platform username searches, data breach exposure analysis, and advanced facial recognition-based avatar matching.

## 🚀 Key Features

### 🔍 Multi-Platform Username Search
*   **Fast Discovery:** Scans 50+ social media platforms, forums, and sites simultaneously.
*   **Extensible:** Uses a data-driven YAML provider system and supports custom Python plugins.
*   **Advanced Detection:** Uses success/error patterns and HTTP status codes to minimize false positives.

### 🛡️ Breach Intelligence
*   **HIBP Integration:** Seamlessly check Have I Been Pwned for account exposure across thousands of known leaks.
*   **Detailed Records:** Deep integration with providers like Breach.VIP to retrieve specific leaked data (passwords, salts, IPs) directly on the dashboard.
*   **Unified Reporting:** Consolidates breach data into a specialized, easy-to-read table.

### 👤 Advanced Face Matcher
*   **Dual-Mode Comparison:** 
    *   **Facial Recognition:** Compares custom avatars using high-accuracy facial landmarks.
    *   **Image Hashing:** Uses perceptual hashing (pHash) to identify default or generic avatars.
*   **Visual Evidence:** Provides match confidence scores to help verify identity across platforms.

### 🖼️ Reverse Image OSINT
*   **One-Click Search:** Perform reverse image searches via Google Lens, Bing, Yandex, and specialized engines like PimEyes or FaceCheck.ID.
*   **Image Hosting:** Securely handles temporary image uploads for analysis.

## 🛠️ Architecture

Social-Hunt is built with a modern, decoupled architecture:
*   **Backend:** High-performance Python API powered by **FastAPI** and **httpx** for asynchronous scanning.
*   **Frontend:** A clean, responsive dashboard built with vanilla JavaScript and CSS (no heavy frameworks required).
*   **Core Engine:** Asynchronous task runner with built-in rate limiting and concurrency control.
